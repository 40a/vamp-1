Vamp is actively developed by [Magnetic.io](http://magnetic.io) but is an open source project. 
We encourage anyone to pitch in with pull requests, issues etc.

Note: We are currently in alpha. This means the API will change, features will be added/removed and there will be bugs. Having said that:

*We accept bug reports and pull requests on GitHub*.

* If you have a question about how to use Vamp, please [check the Vamp documentation first](http://vamp.io/documentation/).

* If you have a change or new feature in mind, please [suggest it by creating an issue on](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues) and tag it with "feature proposal"

Thanks! :heart: 

The Vamp team
