Vamp is actively developed by [Magnetic.io](http://magnetic.io) but is an open source project. 
We encourage anyone to pitch in with pull requests, issues etc.

Note: We are currently in alpha. This means the API will change, features will be added/removed and there will be bugs. Having said that:


*Vamp is split into separate repos and projects, just like actual microservices... :metal

1. [Vamp-core](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-core) : the brains of the organization.
2. [Vamp-pulse](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-pulse) : takes care of storing and retrieving metrics and events.
3. [Vamp-router](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-router) : routes, balances and filters traffic in clever ways.

*We accept bug reports and pull requests on the GitHub repo for each project*.

* If you have a question about how to use Vamp, please [check the Vamp documentation first](http://vamp.io/documentation/).

* If you have a change or new feature in mind, please [suggest it by creating an issue](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp/issues) and tag it with "feature proposal"

Keep Vamping! :heart: 

The Vamp team
