# How to contribute to Vamp?

Vamp is actively developed by [Magnetic.io](http://magnetic.io) but is an open source project. 
We encourage anyone to pitch in with pull requests, issues etc. Vamp is split into separate repos and projects: 
check the source [on Github](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp) for an overview of all key repos.

Keep Vamping!
