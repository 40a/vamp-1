Vamp is the Very Awesome Microservices Platform. Vamp is open source and mostly written in Scala, with some
parts in Go. Of course, Vamp is made of multiple services itself. Monolith bad, services good...

1. [Vamp-core](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-core) : the brains of the organization.
2. [Vamp-pulse](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-pulse) : takes care of storing and retrieving metrics and events.
3. [Vamp-router](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-router) : routes, balances and filters traffic in clever ways.

## More about Vamp

* Vamp is not a PaaS, but uses the power of PaaS systems under the hood, starting with the [Mesosphere](http://mesosphere.com) stack
* Vamp is functionality agnostic, but functions well in an API centric, event driven and stateless environment. 
* Vamp is inspired by [Netflix OSS](http://netflix.github.io/) but also by Reactive programming patterns. Vamp comes in an open source flavour and an Enterpriseâ„¢ flavour.
* Vamp strongly focusses on giving you the benefit of microservices, without the downsides.
