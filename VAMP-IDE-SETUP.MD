# VAMP IDE Setup

This document describes on how to configure and run from the IntelliJ IDE for developing
VAMP. All the core developers are using IntelliJ as their main IDE for Scala
development, if you want to use another IDE that's fine however we cannot create
a read-me for each possible IDE. If you have any questions or remarks, please shoot
us a message at [Gitter](https://gitter.im/magneticio/vamp).
